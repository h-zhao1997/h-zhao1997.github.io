<h2 id='about'>About Me</h2>

Hi! I'm Han Zhao (赵晗). I hold my bachelor's and master's degrees in Control Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.bupt.edu.cn/">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a> (BUPT) in 2020 and 2023, respectively. I am currently a second-year joint Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a> and <a href="https://www.westlake.edu.cn/">Westlake University</a> (<a href="https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/">Machine Intelligence Lab</a>, MiLAB), advised by Prof. Donglin Wang. 


<h2 id='research-interests'>Research Interests</h2>
My current research interests include Embodied Artificial Intelligence, Foundation Models, Reinforcement Learning, and Robotics. 

Specifically, I am interested in:
- **Foundation Models for Robotics**: developing efficient and effective foundation models for robotics, including multi-modal large language models and vision-language-action models to enhance robots' perception and decision-making capabilities.

- **Scalable Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: developing reinforcement learning algorithms that can effectively manage large-scale data and model capacity for robotic control. This includes methods such as offline reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and more, to enable robots to acquire scalable and generalizable skills.

- **Motion Planning and Control for Legged Robots**: developing motion planning and control algorithms for legged robots, including bipedal and quadruped robots, to enable them to perform complex tasks in real-world environments.
